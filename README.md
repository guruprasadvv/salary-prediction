üíº Salary Prediction Using Random Forest
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict employee salaries based on various features such as education, experience, job title, and location.
The Random Forest Regressor is applied to build a robust predictive model that handles non-linear relationships and minimizes overfitting.

üß† Key Features
  -Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data, etc.)

  -Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization

  -Model training using Random Forest Regressor

  -Model evaluation using metrics like MAE, and RMSE
